# ðŸ“š Review:
    # Python environment set up
	# Python debugging tools 
	# Python datatypes 

# ðŸš¨ To enable ipdb debugging, first import "ipdb"
import ipdb

# Snake_Case = Python
# camelCase = JavaScript
pet_mood = "Hungry!"
pet_name = "Rose"

# 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
    # If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
    # If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
    # In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

# we can use "set_trace" to override previously set values /
# test different outcomes
# ipdb.set_trace()


# if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
#     print("Rose needs to be fed.")
# elif pet_mood == "Rowdy!":
#     print("Rose needs a walk.")
# else:
#     print("Rose is all good.")

    # Note => Feel free to set your own values for "pet_mood" to view various outputs.



# 2. âœ… Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:
    # If pet_food is "Hungry!" => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # In all other cases => "Rose is all good."

# print("Rose needs to be fed.") if pet_mood == "Hungry!" else print("Rose is all good.")

# 3. âœ… Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"
    # Test invocation of "say_hello" in ipdb using "say_hello()"
    # say_hello() => "Hello, world!"

# def say_hello(name = "Student"):
#     print(f"Hello, {name}")

# say_hello("Memo")

# 4. âœ… Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name
    # Test invocation of "pet_greeting" in ipdb using "pet_greeting()"
    # pet_greeting("Rose") => "Rose says hello!"
    # pet_greeting("Spot") => "Spot says hello!"

# Global Scope
# name = "Bud"

# # Function Scope
# def pet_greeting():
#     global name #overrides the global variable  name = "Bud"
#     name = "Spot" #overrideing global variable to name = "Spot"
#     print(f"{name} says hello!")


# pet_greeting()
# pet_greeting("Rose")
# pet_greeting("Spot")

# if def DOES NOT  have default argument, WITH name interpolated in print, python will use name = "Bud" in Global Scope
# if def DOES HAVE default argument, it will use the variable in function scope over global variable. 

# 5. âœ… Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods
    # Test invocation of "pet_status" in ipdb using "pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood)"
    # pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!") => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # pet_greeting("Spot", "Rowdy!") => "Spot needs a walk."
    # pet_greeting("Bud", "Relaxed") => "Bud is all good."


# def pet_status (pet_name, pet_mood):
#     if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
#         print(f"{pet_name} needs to be fed.")
#     elif pet_mood == "Rowdy!":
#         print(f"{pet_name} needs a walk.")
#     else:
#         print(f"{pet_name} is all good.")

# pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!")
# pet_status("Spot", "Rowdy!")
# pet_status("Bud", "Feisty!")



    
    # Take a moment to note that "pet_name" and "pet_mood" parameters are within Local Scope and take priority over "pet_name" and "pet_mood"
    # in Global Scope.

# 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors. 
    # If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
    # pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
    # pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"


def pet_birthday(age):
    try: # TRY this logic or ATTEMPT to excecute code
        age = age + 1
        print(f"Happy Birthday! Your pet is now {age}")
    except TypeError: # you can have many different exepts to check if theres a incorrect data type 
        print("Type Error Occured!")
    except NameError:
        print("Name Error Occured!")


pet_birthday(10)
